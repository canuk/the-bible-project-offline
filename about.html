        <h1>What is The Bible Project?</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="container">
        <p>The Bible Project is a Portland based non-profit that utilizes short-form, fully animated videos to make the biblical story accessible to everyone, everywhere. We create videos, podcasts, and study guides that explore the Bible&#8217;s unified story by focusing on its overarching themes and each book&#8217;s literary design. We are committed to understanding the Bible in its historical context and communicating its wisdom for the modern world.</p>
        <p>We want to change how people read and use the Bible. For some, the Bible is used as a devotional grab bag. For others it is a instructional manual that fell out of the sky. And for many, it is an oppressive book of out-dated rules used to control people. We believe that the Bible is a divine-human book that speaks God&#8217;s word to his people. We think it points people to Jesus, who has power to change individuals and whole communities. When we let the biblical story speak for itself, we believe it has immense wisdom to offer the modern world.</p>
        <p>The Bible Project is not part of any specific Christian denomination or tradition. Our mission is to help people see the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus. We hope that people from all backgrounds will find value in this work, regardless of their religious or non-religious convictions.</p>
        <h2>Organization Facts</h2>
        <p>Timothy Mackie and Jonathan Collins (long-time friends and one-time roommates at Multnomah Bible College) were tossing around ideas on how to help people read through Scripture. What would be a way to present the complex themes of the bible in way that was engaging, approachable, and transformative?</p>
        <p>Combining Tim&#8217;s deep biblical understanding and Jon&#8217;s passion for visual story-telling, they created their first two videos in 2014 and put them online for free.</p>
        <p>We are now a registered 501(c)3 and full-time labor of love made up of artists, illustrators, designers, supporters and prayer warriors. This is a collaborative, community-oriented endeavor. We have relied on crowd-funding from the beginning up till today. We are honored by those who partner with us to make each video happen.</p>
        <p>Our funding is predominantly a crowd-funded model. We also accept designated donations from viewers for future content.</p>
        <p>All of our videos are viewable from our YouTube channel where we have accrued nearly 5 Million views and have over 100,000 subscribers. Our YouTube viewership is primarily ages 18-35, 65% male, 35% female.</p>
        <p>Our videos are used in churches, schools, and family homes throughout the world. They have been viewed in 229 sovereign territories where YouTube is accessible.</p>
        <p>We are beginning full localization efforts in pilot languages and countries. We have over 150 video subtitles provided by volunteers on our YouTube videos.</p>

Tim discovered the wonderful world of biblical studies and languages at Multnomah University and Western Seminary, and had the privilege of doing a PhD in Hebrew and Jewish Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>

        <h4>Jonathan Collins</h4>
        <p>Jon was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest and is proud to call Portland home. He has been married for 11 years and has two boys.</p>
        <p>Jon received a BA in Bible and Theology at Multnomah University. After working overseas in Christian ministry and then serving for a year as a Pastor, Jon stepped into the marketplace to explore digital communication. He started two digital communication companies and worked with clients ranging from Google and P&amp;G to Silicon Valley start-ups and non-profits. In 2009 Jon&#8217;s first company, Epipheo, introduced the business world to &#8220;explainer videos.&#8221; Jon has a long history of creating shareable videos that spread messages organically on the internet.</p>
        <p>In early 2016 Jon ended his participation in former business ventures to work on The Bible Project full time. He is thrilled to be working on something so meaningful.</p>
