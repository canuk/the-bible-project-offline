          <h2>Heaven &amp; Earth</h2>
          <p>This fully animated video dives into the mystical intersecting of heaven and earth-different dimensions overlapping in the same space. Say what? Yeah, pretty cool.</p>

          <h2>The Messiah</h2>
          <p>From Genesis to Revelation, from The Garden of Eden to the second coming of Christ, from Old to New Testament, the story of the Messiah--a man who will come and crush evil-- is woven throughout the Bible.</p>

          <h2>The Covenants</h2>
          <p>What are covenants? (Spoiler: NOT vampire families). This fully animated film clarifies the story of partnership with God, a theme that runs from Exodus to Revelation.</p>

          <h2>Image of God</h2>
          <p>This fully animated narrative video talks about the Bible's intersecting story of man's destiny and God's authority, from the Garden to the new world, and what it means for mankind's calling to rule the world. </p>

          <h2>Gospel of the Kingdom</h2>
          <p>In Isaiah 52 a messenger comes to tell the good news that God still reigns and that he is coming to bring his reign to earth. This fully animated video illustrates the Gospel (Good News) of God's Upside Down Kingdom.</p>

          <h2>The Law</h2>
          <p>Why did God give Israel the Law? How does the law relate to those who follow Jesus? The Torah, translated as "the law," isn't just a set of rules. This video illustrates the overarching story of God's desire to be in relationship with His people.</p>

          <h2>Holiness</h2>
          <p>What does it mean for God to be holy? How do you have a relationship with a holy God? This fully animated video discusses the notion of God's Holiness as not just morally perfect, but also as supremely pure and powerful.</p>

          <p>Why do Christians dunk themselves in water and clap? And what's the story with The Lord's Supper? This fully animated video dives into all of these questions and illustrates the purpose behind rituals of the Christian faith.</p>

          <h2>Holy Spirit</h2>
          <p>The "Holy Spirit” is a phrase in the Bible used to describe the mystery and power of God’s personal presence. In this video we explore the original Hebrew meaning of the word “spirit/breath,” and how understanding this can help you see the storyline of the entire Bible in a whole new way.</p>

      <h1>Wisdom Series</h1>
      <p>What does it mean to live well in God's good world? Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Job comprise the Bible's wisdom literature, and they join together to answer that question from three very distinct points of view.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <img class="img-responsive" src="img/wisdom/TBP-Web-Thumbnail-PROV-1.jpg"/><br/>
          <h2>Proverbs</h2>
          <p>This fully animated video is the first in our Wisdom Series that dives into three books (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job) that provide scriptural advice for how to live well in the world. Using the metaphor of the "personality" of each book, we imagine Proverbs as an enlightened teacher-one who speaks of khockmah (wisdom) and the essence of God, Lady Wisdom, who guides us to use khockmah to create a blessed life.</p>

          <h2>Ecclesiastes</h2>
          <p>While Proverbs talks about living with Lady Wisdom as your guide to the good life, the critic of Ecclesiastes offers a bit more of a sobering perspective: Everything is meaningless, and we’re all going to die. Ouch. Nevertheless, this book offers surprising insight into how to life joyfully in an imperfect world. Join us as we learn about life’s game of chance, and what that means for people of faith.</p>

          <h2>Job</h2>
          <p>This fully animated video is the third in our Wisdom Series that dives into three books (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job) that provide scriptural advice for how to live well in the world.</p>

      <h1>Gospel Series</h1>
      <p>The Gospels in the New Testament tell the one story of Jesus from four distinct points of view. This fully animated series explores the unique literary design and key themes of each Gospel account.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <img class="img-responsive" src="img/gospel/TBP-Web-Thumbnail-LKE-1-Blank.jpg"/><br/>
          <h2>Luke</h2>
          <p>See how Jesus’ announcement of good news for the poor began with the circumstances of his birth. His entry into the world brought Israel’s ancient hopes to their fulfillment, and also began to turn the values of our world order upside-down.</p>

          <h2>Mark</h2>
          <p>John Mark, master story-teller, gives us this Gospel addressing the question: Is Jesus the Jewish Messiah? Detailing the life of Jesus, Mark highlights the tension between the Jew's hopes about what the conquering Messiah would do (overthrow the Romans), and the reality of what Jesus came to do (be sacrificed by the Romans). Addressing the "Who" of Jesus in the first part of the book, and and the "How" of what He came to do in the third, Mark offers insight into the conflicting expectations that God's people had for their coming King. What did Jesus say to these conditions? How did He respond to His followers?</p>

      <h1>Torah Series</h1>
      <p>You’ve tried it before: jumped in at Genesis and got lost in the “who begat who” part! This animated series takes you through the first five books of the Bible in a way that won’t beget confusion.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <img class="img-responsive" src="img/torah/TBP-Web-Thumbnail-GEN1.jpg"/><br/>
          <h2>Genesis 1-11</h2>
          <p>Creation. Destruction. Reboot. Repeat. This first video in the two-part Genesis series explores the main theme that runs through the first part of the book: Man's desire for autonomy from God.</p>

          <h2>Genesis 12-50</h2>
          <p>God makes a promise that He will bless all nations through Abraham's line. But with aging husbands, impatient matriarchs, blessing-stealing children, and jealous siblings who keep mucking things up, how will God's promise prevail?</p>

          <h2>Exodus 1-18</h2>
          <p>Following the lineage of God's chosen people from Jacob to Moses, the first video in this two-part Exodus series tells the story of the Israelites as they journey from favor to enslavement to freedom to exile.</p>

          <h2>Exodus 19-40</h2>
          <p>Exile, Commandments, the Tabernacle. What sound like 90's band names are actually themes in this Exodus part 2 video that detail the capricious nature of the Israelites and God's unfailing promise to draw them near.</p>

          <h2>Leviticus</h2>
          <p>Though the seemingly gruesome practices and obvious obsession with goats can seem strange, Leviticus makes one theme very clear: nothing is arbitrary when it comes to the Israelite's God.</p>

          <h2>Deuteronomy</h2>
          <p>Broken up into three main sections, Deuteronomy finds the Israelites poised to enter the promised land. Moses gives them a pep-talk that's basically like "Hey, remember all the times since the dawn of man that you've disobeyed God? STOP DOING THAT." He extols them to listen (obey the rules of the covenant) and love (cultivate the true motivation for obeying the laws) to be fruitful in the promised land. Will they? (Spoiler: Probably not. But God's gonna somehow redeem it anyway).</p>

          <h2>Shema - "Listen"</h2>
          <p>The first installment of our new Word Studies series is an exploration of the ancient biblical prayer called “The Shema” (found in Deuteronomy 6:4-6). For thousands of years Jewish people have daily prayed these words which summarize the Bible’s call for faithfulness and devotion to God. We will explore all of the key words in this prayer and what they meant in their original language and historical context.</p>
